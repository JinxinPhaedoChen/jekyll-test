I am currently a PhD student working on Biophysics and Genome biology at the Karolinska Institutet and the SciLifeLab. I graduated with a B.S. in chemistry at West China Hospital from Sichuan University in June 2021. After that, I finished my freshman work of PhD under the supervision of Xiaoliang Sunney Xie at BIOPIC from Peking University.
